## On ✔
     
     
   <p>This is the BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator, which adds up your weight and your height and shows you which is the current
   physical condition of your body, whether you are overweight or not.</p>
   
   
## Roadmap 🗺
   
   <p> When I decided to make this calculator I was thinking about my physical condition
   I thought a lot that I was overweight and that I had fat problems. And I decided to practice a little more
   what I'm studying so I made the calculator to be able to access information about my physical condition more easily! </p>
